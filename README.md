# BlogPost

### Description:
This project demonstrates the practical application of ASP.NET MVC framework for developing a simple blog post platform. It incorporates various technologies and concepts, including Microsoft SQL Server, ASP.NET MVC architecture, database integration, user authentication and authorization, front-end development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and deployment considerations.
### Features:
+ ASP.NET MVC: Utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to promote code organization and modularity.
+ Microsoft SQL Server: Integrates a database for efficient storage and retrieval of blog posts and related data.
+ User Authentication and Authorization: Implements secure login functionality, user registration, and role-based access control to manage blog post creation and editing permissions.
+ Front-end Development: Enhances the user experience through responsive layouts, CSS frameworks, and client-side interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
+ Deployment Considerations: Explores deployment options, including cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS), configuration of domain names, and server-side requirements.
### Learning Outcomes:
+ Applied knowledge of ASP.NET MVC framework, including models, views, controllers, and routing.
+ Practical experience in implementing CRUD operations and database integration using Microsoft SQL Server
+ Understanding of user authentication, authorization, and security considerations in ASP.NET MVC.
+ Proficiency in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsive and interactive layouts.
+ Awareness of deployment and hosting considerations, including cloud platforms and server-side requirements.

This project serves as a valuable learning experience, allowing developers to gain hands-on experience with ASP.NET MVC, database integration, user management, front-end development, and deployment aspects. It provides a foundation for further exploration of web application development and building more complex projects in the future.

## Disclaimer:
+ Keep in mind I work in this project a lot and the features changes a lot and verry often
